        <h2>Who is The Witcher 3's Triss?</h2>
        <p>
          Well, how long have you got? There's both a long and short answer to
          this question, but I shall try to find some healthy middleground, as I
          could gush about Triss Merigold all day. Triss Merigold of Maribor is
          a legendary sorceress from Temeria, and not just any magic wielder,
          but a member of The Lodge of Sorceresses (of which she is a founding
          member), which makes her an especially powerful witch, and a
          much-wanted target come the events of Wild Hunt. Not only that, but
          she holds an especially close friendship with fellow Lodge member,
          Yennefer of Vengerberg. Of course, that isn't enough to stop Triss
          from entering a relationship with Geralt of Rivia at the first
          opportunity despite the bond between Geralt and Yen, but this is not
          the place to discuss that. Besides Yen and Geralt, Triss is close with
          all manner of people, including Ciri, who the sorceress regards as a
          little sister. Prior to his demise, Triss served in King Foltest's
          royal court as his advisor, meaning she's well-versed in the world of
          politics. Sure, there's plenty more we could address, but you get the
          point, right? She's an extremely important figure in not just The
          Witcher 3 but all three games in the series.

        <h2>What is The Witcher 3 Triss' role in the story?</h2>
        <p>
          Triss Merigold doesn't show up in the game for a fair few hours, and
          that, of course, comes down to how much time you spend in Velen before
          making your way to Novigrad, the city in which the sorceress resides.
          Upon arriving, Geralt discovers that she's gone into hiding due to the
          ongoing witch hunts, of which she's one of the most wanted magic
          users. In the end, Triss succeeds in her mission to get her fellow
          mages out of Novigrad. Depending on Geralt's interactions with her up
          until this point, a romance may evolve, resulting in Triss going to
          Kaer Morhen to help fight off the Wild Hunt. However, should she leave
          Novigrad on the ship, she still ends up at the Witcher school, thanks
          to Yennefer. In the final act of the game, much like in Novigrad,
          there are a few quests that you can embark on with Triss, especially
          as she's responsible for finding fellow Lodge member Philipa Eilhart.
          Naturally, Triss is also part of the final battle against the hunt, as
          she and her fellow sorceresses use their magic to wreak havoc on the
          battlefield.

        <h2>The Witcher 3 Triss' personality</h2>
        <p>
          Let's just get the ugly out of the way because as much as it hurts me
          to say it, Triss Merigold is far from perfect when you take into
          account her blatant manipulation of Geralt when he suffers from
          amnesia. However, that manipulation isn't on display in The Witcher 3.
          In fact, Triss displays some remorse for her previous actions. On the
          whole, Triss Merigold is a kind and caring individual that will fight
          for what's right, even if it means putting her own life on the line,
          much to the dismay of Geralt at times. She's also fearless,
          combat-ready, and loyal to a fault to those that she cares about.
